Module: Interacting with Google Cloud

Using Google Cloud:

There  are 4 ways to interact with GCP
Google Cloud Platform Console - Web User Interface
Google Shell Cloud SDK - CLI interface
REST-based API - for custom applications
Cloud Mobile App - for IOS and Android

This is building on the fundamentals from the previous course. In this module we predominately learned from 2 labs. 

LAB 1: Working with GCP Cloud Console and Cloud Shell
1. Using the Google Cloud Console to create a bucket
	A. Logged into the GCP console. 
	B. In the Console used the Navigation Menu to go to Cloud Storage > Browser.
	C. Selected Create Bucket.
	D. Named the bucket, I used the Project ID for the project to ensure a globally unique name. 
	E. Selected Create. 

2. Access Cloud Shell
	A. Selected Activate Cloud Shell.

3. Use Cloud Shell to create a Storage bucket. 
	A. Opened Cloud Shell
	B. In the shell ran the command "gsutil mb gs://<bucket name> 
		a. for the <bucket name> I named the bucket after the project id and added -2 to the end because it needs to be globally unique. 
	C. Verified the bucket existed from the Console by checking Navigation menu > Cloud Storage > Browser. 

4. Explore more Cloud Shell features.
	A. In Cloud Shell I selected the More button (3 vertical dots)
	B. Selected Upload file.
	C. Uploaded a file from my local machine of my choosing. 
	D. In Cloud Shell I could verify the upload completed from the ls command. 
	E. I copied the file that was uploaded to the storage bucket I had previously created. 
		a. gsutil cp <my file name> gs://<bucket name>
	F. Checked the bucket I had uploaded the file to from the console to verify the file was present. 

5. Create a persistant state in the Cloud Shell. 
	A. listed the available regions from the console by command.
		a. gcloud compute regions list
	B. Selected a region from the list to be my region.
	C. Created an environment variable. 
		a. ran the command INFRACLASS_REGION=<region>
	D. Verified the variable was present.
		a. echo $INFRACLASS_REGION
	E. Appended the environment variable to a file. 
		a. mkdir infraclass (create a directory)
		b. touch infraclass/config (create a file)
		c. echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config (append environment variable to the config file).
	F. Create a second environment variable, one for the project id, and append it to the config file.
		a. INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=<project id>
		b. append the project id to the config file.
			i. echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config
		c. was able to see both variables in the file by checking the file
			i. cat ~/infraclass/config
		d. Upon closing and re-opening the shell i was able to verify the environment variables no longer existed because they are not persistant yet. 

6. Modifying the bash profile to create persistance.
	A. Edited the sell profile file with the nano editor. 
		a. Nano .profile
		b. added a line to the bottom of the file
			i. source infraclass/config
		c. Ctl + O, and confirmed the file path to save
		d. Ctl + x, to close nano. 
	B. Close and re-open shell
	C. Able to see that the environemnt variables have now saved when checking environment variables.
		a. echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
		b. echo $INFRACLASS_REGION
		
LAB 2: Infrastructure Preview
	A. Use Marketplace to build a Deployment. 
		a. Went to Marketplace from the Console.
		b. Searched for Jenkins Certified by Bitnami
		c. Selected the product, and selected Launch. 
		d. Pressed Deploy to deploy the instance. 
	B. Verified the deployment
		a. Copied the admin user and password down. 
		b. From the console I visited the site and was able to login with the credentials. 
		c. Verified I was able access the Manage Jenkins tab from the left side of the window. 
	C. Administer the service. 
		a. Went to Deployment Manager. 
		b. Clicked the jenkins-1 instance.
		c. SSH'd to the server.
		d. Stopped the jenkins service
			i. sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh stop
			ii. Verified I could no longer access the site. 
		e. restarted the service. 
			i. sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart
			ii. verified I was able to access the site again (took a minute or two for the service to start. 
		f. ran exit command to leave the SSH session.
