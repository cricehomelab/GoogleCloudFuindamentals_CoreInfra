GCP Virtual Machines in the Cloud

Compute Engine - the name of the service that allows Virtual Machines to be run in GCP. 

Objective:
Focus of this course is how Google Compute Engine works (especially with Virtual Networking)

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

- Each VPC Network is contained in a GCP Project
- When you provision GCP resources you can connect them to each other or isolate them from each other. 

The VPC networks are global
The VPC subnets are regional

You are able to dynamically increase the size of a subnet in a custom network by expanding the range of IP addresses allocated to it. This will
not affect currently configured VMs.


Compute Engine:

advantages
	 - no upfront cost
	 - Fast consistant performance
	 
These can be created 2 ways 	GCP console
								gcloud command line

The VMs can run Windows Server or Linux
	Images can be out of box images
	premade by Google/Community
	Imported from exisiting physical servers
	
When creating able to configure how much memory and how many CPUs you need
	- also able to add GPUS if needed. 
	
able to choose 2 types of persistant disks
	standard
	SSD

You can attach a local SSD for scratch space (data is not persistant so important data needs to be permanently stored somewhere else)

Startup Scripts can be defined. 

Disk Snapshots can be taken
	- usable as backups
	- usable to migrate to baremetal/other regions
	
Preemptible VM - a VM that is able to be terminated by google if the resources are needed elsewhere
	- Use case is if there is a large work load with no immeadiate need to be looked at by a person. 
	- its important to design the job to be able to be stopped/restarted
	
Make large VMs for memory and compute intensive applications
Make many VMS for fault tolerance and elasticity

Autoscalling can be used for resliliancy and scalable applications.
	- allows to automatically add/remove VMs based on load metrics. 



VPCs have routing tables
Routing table can be used to forward traffic in the network and accross subnets (Without requiring an external IP address). 
Routing tables are built in
VPC's do not need to have a firewall built in, and provide a global distributed firewall. able to control incoming and 
outgoing traffic.

Firewall rules defined in the form of metadata tags and can tag VM Instances with this.
Example 
Tag all webservers with a "Web" tag and allow devices with this tag to be able to send/receive through port 80 and 443

Shared VPC - share a network or individual subnets with other GCP projects. 
	Leverages IAM for who and what in project x can interact with what in project y
VPC Peering - allows interconnection of networks in GCP projects. 
	peering between 2 VPCs
	

Global Cloud Load Balancing - allows an application to present a single front end to the world
	- users get single, global anycast IP address
	- Traffic moves over the google backbone network from the closest Point Of Presence (POP) to the user.
	- Backends are selected based on load.
	- Only healthy backends receive traffic.
	- No pre-warming required.


Load balancing options in GCP

Global HTTP(S)			Layer 7 Load Balancing 		Can route different URLS
						based on load				to different Backends

Global SSL Proxy		Layer 4 load balancing		Supported on specific port
						of non-HTTPS SSL traffic	numbers
						based on load

Global TCP Proxy		Layer 4 load balancing		Suppored on specific port	
						of non-SSL TCP traffic		numbers


Regional				Load balancing of any		Supported on any port #
						Traffic (TCP, UDP)

Regional Internal		Load balancing of 			Use for internal tiers of
						traffic inside a VPC		multi tiered application
						

Google DNS 8.8.8.8 (free google DNS service)

Cloud DNS = create managed zones then add/edit/delete DNS records. 

Cloud CDN (Content Delivery Network)
	- uses google's globally distributed edge caches to cache content close to users. 
	- check box after HTTPS load balancing is configured. 


GCP interconntect options
- VPN - Secure multi-Gbps connection over vpn tunnels
		- Cloud Router makes this dynamic allows other networks and Google VPC exchange route info using Boarder 
		Gateway Protocol. 
		- with Cloud router configured if a new subnet is added to the a google VPC on prem will get routes to it 
		automatically. 
- Direct Peering - Private Connection between you and Google for hybrid cloud workloads
		- involves putting a router in a public data center as a Google POP to exchange traffic. 
- Carrier Peering - connection through partner network of service providers.
		- Similar to Direct Peering, but goes through a Google Partner. 		
- Dedicated Interconnect - Connect N X 10G transport circuits for private cloud traffic to GCP at Google POPSs
		- Peering is not covered by an SLA, but this is. 
		- Can be covered by a google SLA depending on Topology.
