GCP Virtual Machines in the Cloud

Compute Engine - the name of the service that allows Virtual Machines to be run in GCP. 

Objective:
Focus of this course is how Google Compute Engine works (especially with Virtual Networking)

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

- Each VPC Network is contained in a GCP Project
- When you provision GCP resources you can connect them to each other or isolate them from each other. 

The VPC networks are global
The VPC subnets are regional

You are able to dynamically increase the size of a subnet in a custom network by expanding the range of IP addresses allocated to it. This will
not affect currently configured VMs.


Compute Engine:

advantages
	 - no upfront cost
	 - Fast consistant performance
	 
These can be created 2 ways 	GCP console
								gcloud command line

The VMs can run Windows Server or Linux
	Images can be out of box images
	premade by Google/Community
	Imported from exisiting physical servers
	
When creating able to configure how much memory and how many CPUs you need
	- also able to add GPUS if needed. 
	
able to choose 2 types of persistant disks
	standard
	SSD

You can attach a local SSD for scratch space (data is not persistant so important data needs to be permanently stored somewhere else)

Startup Scripts can be defined. 

Disk Snapshots can be taken
	- usable as backups
	- usable to migrate to baremetal/other regions
	
Preemptible VM - a VM that is able to be terminated by google if the resources are needed elsewhere
	- Use case is if there is a large work load with no immeadiate need to be looked at by a person. 
	- its important to design the job to be able to be stopped/restarted
	
Make large VMs for memory and compute intensive applications

Autoscalling can be used for resliliancy and scalable applications.
	- allows to automatically add/remove VMs based on load metrics.
