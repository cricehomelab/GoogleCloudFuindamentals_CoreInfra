GCP Compute Engine

Virtual Machine instances for VMs are supplied by Compute Engine. 

Some weird perks that can happen.
1. Micro VM shares cpu with other vms
2. Burst capability can run briefly above its rated CPU

VM Access and Lifecycle

For accessing a VM the creator has full root privilages on that instance.

VM access Linux (SSH) 
	- SSH from Cloud Console or Cloudshell via Cloud SDK
	- SSH from computer othird party client and Generate Key pair
	- Requires Firewall rule to allow TCP:22

VM Access Windows (RDP)
	- RDP Clients
	- Powershell Terminal
	- requires setting the windows password
	- requires firewall rule to allow tcp:3389

VM Lifecycle
1. Provisioning
	A. vCPUs + Memory
	B. Root disk / persistant disk
	C. Additonal Disks
2. Staging
	A. IP addresses (Internal/External)
	B. System Image
	C. Boot
3. Running ---> Able to Reset the VM. 
	A. Startup script
	B. Access SSH/RDP
	C. Modify Use
		a. Set/get Metadata
		b. Export System Image
		c. Snapshot persistant disk
		d. move VM to a different zone  ------> Live Migrate
	E. Stopping 
		a. Shutdown Scripts
	F. Terminated
		a. Delete
		b. Avaialable policy (this loops back to Provisioning).
			1. Able to restart the unit. 
	
Availability policy
- Scheduling options
- Automatic restart	
	- Automatic restart due to crash/maintenance event
		- Not pre-emption or a user initiated termination
- On host Maintenance
	- Determines whether host is live migrated or terminated due to a maintenance event, live migration is the default
- Live Migration
	- During maintenance event VM is migrated to a different hardware without interruption
	- Metadata indicates occurance of live migration. 

Patch Management
- Able to manage patches through GCloud
	- Keep Infrastructure up to date
	- Reduce risk of security vulnerabilities
- OS Patch Management
	- Patch Compliance reporting
	- Patch Deployment

Patch Management functions
- Create patch approvals
- set up flexible scheduling
- apply advanced patch config settings
- Manage patch jobs or updates from a centralized location.

Stopped or terminated VM
- No charge for a stopped VM
- you are charged for attached disks/reserved IP addresses. 
- Actions that can be taken while stopped	
	- Change Machine type
	- Migrate the VM instance to another network
	- Add or remove attached disks; change auto delete settings
	- modify instance tags
	- Modify custom VM or project wide metadata
	- Remove or set a new static IP
	- Modify VM availability policy
	- CANNOT change the image of a stopped VM.

Working with Virtual Machines:

- standard choices
	- Standard Memory - 3.75 GB of memory per vCPU
	- High Memory - 6.5 GB of memory per vCPU
	- Standard CPU - 0.9 GB of memory per vCPU
	- memory optimized > 14 GB of memory per vCPU
	- compute optimized highest performance per vCPU (3.8 Ghz sustained all core turbo)
	- shared core - cost effective for small (f1-micro g1-small)

- custom machine types when to use:
	- requirements fit between predefined types
	- need more memory or more CPU
	- customizable
		- Either 1 vCPU or an eeven number of vCPU
		- 0.9 GB per vCPU or up to 6.5GB per vCPU
		- Total memory mus bt a multiple of 256 MB

- pricing 	
	- Per second billing (min 1 minute)
		-vCPU, GPUs, and GB of memory
	- resource based pricing
		- each vCPU and each GB of memory is billed separately.
	- Discounts (can use one but not a combination of these)
		- Sustained use
		- committed use
		- Pre-emptible VM instances
	- Recomendation Engine
		- notifies you of underutilized instances.
	- free usage limits. 
	
- preemptible VMs 
	- Lower price for interuptable service (up to 80%)
	- VM might eb terminated at any time
		- no charge if terminated within the first minute
		- 24 hours max.
		- 30-second terminate warning but not guaranteed.
			- time for a shutdown script. 
	- No live migrate or auto restart
		- load balancing can be applied. 
	- You can request CPU quota for a region be split between regular and pre-emption.
		- Default: preemptiible VMs count against region CPU quota. 
- Sole tenant nodes - can help physically isolate hosts from one another for compliance or other needs. 
- shielded vm
	- offer verifiable integrity
	- Secure boot
	- virtual trusted platform module (vTPM)
	- Integrity monitoring
	- requires shielded image. 
	- part of shielded cloud initiative. 
- confidential VMs allow data to be encrypted while it is in use. 
	- encrypts data while it is being processed.
	- Easy to use with no changes to code or performance compromise. 
- N2D Compute Engine VM running on a second generation AMD Epyc processor (code name Rome). 
- provides high memory capacity, high throughput, and supports parallel and compute heavy workloads.


- Images
	- when creating a VM you choose a boot disk.
	- whats in an image
		- boot loader
		- operating system
		- file system structure
		- software
		- customizations
	- public based images.
		- Google, thord party vendors, and community. Also can choose premium images (p).
		- linux 
			- Centos
			- CoreOS
			- Debian
			- RHEL(p)
			- SUSE(p)
			- Ubuntu
			- openSUSE
			- FreeBSD
		- Windows
			- Windows server 2019(p), 2016(p), 2012-r2(p)
			- SQL Server preinstalled on Windows(p)
		- Custom images
			- Create new images from VM: pre-configured or installed SW
			- Import from an on-prem workstation or another cloud.
			- Management features image sharing image family deprecation
- Disk Options
	- VM comes with a single root persistant disk.
	- Image is loaded onto root disk during first boot.
		- Bootable: you can attach to a VM and boot from it.
		- Durable: can survive VM terminate.
	- Some OS images are optimized for Compute Engine
	- Can survive VM deletion if "Delete boot disk when instance is disabled" is disabled.
	- Persistant disk - Network Storage appearing as a block device.
		- attached to a VM through the network interface
		- durable storage: can survive VM terminate
		- Bootable: you can attach to a VM and boot from it.
		- Snapshots: Incremental Backups.
		- Performance: Scales with size
		- HDD (magnetic) or SSD (faster solid state) options.
		- Disk resizing: even while running and attached.
		- Can be attached in read only mode through multiple VMs
		- Zonal or regional	
			- pd-standard
			- pd-ssd
			- pd-balanced
			- pd-extreme (zonal only)
		- Encryption keys
			- Google-managed
			- Customer-managed
			- Customer-supplied
	- Local SSD are physically attached to a VM
		- ephemeral data, not persistant. 
		- More IOPS, lower latency, and higher throughput
		- 375-GB disk up to 8, with a total of 3 TB.
		- Data survives a reset, but not a VM stop or terminate.
		- VM-specific: cannot be reattached to a different VM. 
	- RAM disk
		- tmpfs
		- faster than local disk, slower than memory.
			- Use when your application a file system structure and cannot directly store its own memory.
			- fast scratch disk, or fast cache.
		- very volatile: erases on stop or restart
		- May need a larger machine type if RAM was sized for the application.
		- Consider using a persistant disk to backup ram disk data. 
	- Persistant disk maximums
	
		Machine type	  |	Disk # limits
		shared-core		  |		16
		Standard		  |		128
		high-memory		  |		128
		high-CPU		  |		128
		memory-optimized  |		128
		compute-optimized |		128

	- Persistant disk management differences
	
		Cloud Persistant disk		|	Computer Hardware disk
		Single filesystem is best	|	Partitioning
		Resize (grow) disks			|	repartition disk
		resize file system			|	reformat
		Built-in snapshot service	|	redundant disk arrays
		Automatic Encryption		|	Subvolume management and snapshots
									|	Encrypt files before writing to disk

	- Common Compute Engine actions
		- metadata is stored on metadata server.
		- moving instances to a new zone
			- Automated processed
				- Command: gcloud compute instances move
			- Manual process (moving regions)
				- snapshot all persistent disks on the source VM.
				- Create new persistant disks in destination zone restored from snapshots
				- Create new VM in the destination zone restored from snapshots.
				- assign static IPs to new VM.
				- Update references to VM.
				- Delete the snapshots, original disks, and original VM. 
		- persistant disk snapshots
			- Snapshot is not availabl for local SSD
			- Creates an incremental backup to Cloud Storage.
				- not visible in your buckets: managed by the snapshot service.
				- Consider cron jobs for periodic incremental backup.
			- Snapshots can be restored to a new persistent disk.
				- New disks can be in another region or zone in the same project.
				- Basis of VM Migration: "moving" a VM to a new zone. 
					- Snapshot doesn't backup metadata, tags, etc.
		- Resize persistent disk.
			- you can grow a persistant disk but you cannot shrink it.
