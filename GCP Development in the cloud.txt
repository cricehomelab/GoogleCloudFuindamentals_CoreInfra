	- Create triggers in code that alert GCP you are interested in a particular event. 
		- Attached functions written in javascript executed in a managed Node.js environment on GCP

- Deployment Manger

	- automates GCP resources
	- Create a yaml or python configuration file
		- file describes what your environment should look like and what resources would need to be 
		created.
