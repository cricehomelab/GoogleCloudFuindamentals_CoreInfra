Virtual Networks

Virtual Private Cloud

VPC Objects
	- Projects - encompass every service including networks. 
	- Networks 
		- Default
		- Auto mode
		- Custom Mode
	- Subnetworks - allow to divide or segregate network. 
	- Regions
	- Zones
	- IP Addresses
		- Internal
		- External
		- Range
	- Virtual Machines 
	- Routes
	- Firewall Rules

Projects, networks and subnetworks
	- Projects
		- Associates objects and services with billing
		- Contains networks (up to 5 that can be shared/peered)
	- Networks	
		- No IP address range
		- Is Global and spans all available regions
		- Contains Subnetworks
		- Is available in 3 flavors 
			- default
				- every project
				- one subnet per region
				- default firewall rules
				- This is the original default setting for any project made. 
					- technically this is an Auto mode network. 
			- Auto
				- Default Network - is technically an auto netork. 
				- One subnet per region
				- Regional IP allocation
				- Fixed /20 subnetwork per region
				- Expandable to up to /16
			- custom
				- No default subnets created
				- Full control of IP ranges
				- Regional IP ranges
				- Expandable to IP Ranges you specify
				- cannot be changed down to a auto mode network. 
		- Networks help to isolate systems.
			- If there are 2 VMs on the SAME network but the VMS are located in different regions.
				- These VMs can still communicate between each other using internal IPs because they are on the same network. 
			- If there are 2 VMs that are located in DIFFERENT networks but in the SAME region.
				- they must communicate using external IPs because they are not on the same network.
		- subnetworks work on a regional scale
			- VMs can be on the same subnet but be located in different zones
			- A single firewall rule can apply to both vms.
		- Expand Subnets with recreating instances
			- Cannot overlap with other subnets in any region. 
			- IP range must be a unique valid CIDR (classless inter-domain routing) block
				- CIDR - is a method for allocating IP Addresses and for IP Routing. 
			- New subnet IP ranges have to fall within valid ranges
			- Can expand but cannot shrink
			- Auto mode can be expanded from /20 to /16
			- Avoid large subnets
				- more likely to cause CIDR range collisions. 
				- Do not scale a subnet beyond what is necisary. 
	Expand a custom subnet
		this can be expanded from the VPC menu and editing the details of the vpc under the "IP address range" field.
	IP Addresses
		- Internal IP
			- allocated from subnet range to VMs by DHCP
			- Lease renewed every 24 hours
			- VM name + IP is registered with network-scoped DNS
		- External IP (Optional)
			- You only have to assign if you need the machine to be internet facing. 
			- there are 3 different flavors of external IP
				- Ephemeral - assigned from a pool of addresses (cheapest)
				- Reserved - Static (more expensive)
				- Bring your own (BYOIP) 
					- to be eligible you need to bring a /24 block or larger. 
			- The VM does not know its external IP it is mapped to the internal IP. 
	DNS Resolution for Internal IP Addresses.
		- Each instance has a hostname that can be resolved for an internal IP address.
			- The hostname is the same as the instance name.
			- The FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) is [hostname].[zone].c.[project-id].internal
		- Name resolution is handled by internal DNS Resolver. 
			- Provided as part of compute engine (169.254.169.254)
			- Configured for use on instance via DHCP
			- Provides answer for internal and external IP addresses.
	DNS Resolution for External IP Addresses.
		- Instances with External IP addresses can allow connections from hosts outside of the project.
			- users connect directly using external IP addresses.
			- admins can also publish DNS records pointing to the instance.
				- Public DNS records are not published automatically. 
		- DNS records for external addresses can be published using exisiting DNS servers (outside of GCP).
		- DNS zones can be hosted using Cloud DNS. 	
	Hosting DNS Zones using Cloud DNS
		- Googles DNS service
		- Translates domain names into IP addresses
		- low latency
		- high availability (100% uptime SLA)
		- Create and update millions of DNS records.
		- Able to be interacted with from UI command line or API
	Assign a range of ip addresses as aliases to a VM's network interface using alias IP ranges.
		- useful if you have multiple services running on a single VM and you want to assign a different IP address
		each service. 
	Routes and Firewall rules
		- Every network has:
			- Routes that let instances in a network send traffic directly to each other
			- A default route that directs packets to desinations that are outside the network. 
				- Custom routes can also be defined. 
		- Firewall rules must also allow the packet. 
		- Routes map traffic to desitination networks.
			- Apply to a traffic egressing a VM.
			- Forward traffic to most specific route.
			- Are created when a subnet is created.
			- Enable VMs on the same network to communicate.
			- Destination is ina CIDR notation.
			- Traffic is delivered only if it also matches a firewall rule. 
		- Firewall rules protect you VM instances from unapproved connections.
			- VPC network functions as a distributed firewall. 
			- Firewall rules are applied to the network as a whole.
			- Connections are allowed or denied at the instance level.
			- Firewall rules are stateful.
				- if traffic is allowed between a source and a target all subsequent traffic in either direction will be allowed. 
				- IE bidirectional traffic is allowed once a connection is established. 
			- Implied deny on all ingress and allow all egress. 
		- Firewall rule is composed of the following components.
			- direction
				- Inbound connections are matched against ingress rules only.
				- Outbound connections are matched agains egress rules only.
			- Source or destination.
				- For the ingress direction, sources can be specified as part of the rule with IP addresses, sources tags or a source service account.
				- For the egress direction, destinations can be specified as part of the rule with one or more ranges of ip addresses.
			- protocol and port - Any Rule can be restricted to apply to only specific protocols or specific combinations of protocols and ports only.
			- action - to allow or deny packets that match the dircection, protocol, port and source or destination of the rule. 
			- priority - Governs the order in which rules are evaluated.
			- Rule assignment - All rules are assigned to all instances but you can assign certain rules to certain instances only. 
		- Egress rules - control outgoing connections originating inside of your GCP network
			- Conditions:
				- Destination CIDR ranges
				- protocols
				- ports
			- Actions:
				- Allow: Permit the matching egress connection
				- Deny: block the matching egress connection
		- Ingress rules - Protect against incoming connections to the instance from any source. 
			- Conditions:
				- Source CIDR ranges
				- Protocols
				- ports
			- Action
				- Allow: permitt he matching ingress connection
				- Deny: Block the matching ingress connection
