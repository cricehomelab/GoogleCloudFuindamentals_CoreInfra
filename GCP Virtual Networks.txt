Virtual Networks

Virtual Private Cloud

VPC Objects
	- Projects - encompass every service including networks. 
	- Networks 
		- Default
		- Auto mode
		- Custom Mode
	- Subnetworks - allow to divide or segregate network. 
	- Regions
	- Zones
	- IP Addresses
		- Internal
		- External
		- Range
	- Virtual Machines 
	- Routes
	- Firewall Rules

Projects, networks and subnetworks
	- Projects
		- Associates objects and services with billing
		- Contains networks (up to 5 that can be shared/peered)
	- Networks	
		- No IP address range
		- Is Global and spans all available regions
		- Contains Subnetworks
		- Is available in 3 flavors 
			- default
				- every project
				- one subnet per region
				- default firewall rules
				- This is the original default setting for any project made. 
					- technically this is an Auto mode network. 
			- Auto
				- Default Network - is technically an auto netork. 
				- One subnet per region
				- Regional IP allocation
				- Fixed /20 subnetwork per region
				- Expandable to up to /16
			- custom
				- No default subnets created
				- Full control of IP ranges
				- Regional IP ranges
				- Expandable to IP Ranges you specify
				- cannot be changed down to a auto mode network. 
		- Networks help to isolate systems.
			- If there are 2 VMs on the SAME network but the VMS are located in different regions.
				- These VMs can still communicate between each other using internal IPs because they are on the same network. 
			- If there are 2 VMs that are located in DIFFERENT networks but in the SAME region.
				- they must communicate using external IPs because they are not on the same network.
		- subnetworks work on a regional scale
			- VMs can be on the same subnet but be located in different zones
			- A single firewall rule can apply to both vms.
		- Expand Subnets with recreating instances
			- Cannot overlap with other subnets in any region. 
			- IP range must be a unique valid CIDR (classless inter-domain routing) block
				- CIDR - is a method for allocating IP Addresses and for IP Routing. 
			- New subnet IP ranges have to fall within valid ranges
			- Can expand but cannot shrink
			- Auto mode can be expanded from /20 to /16
			- Avoid large subnets
				- more likely to cause CIDR range collisions. 
				- Do not scale a subnet beyond what is necisary.
