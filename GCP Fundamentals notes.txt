Intro Module (VERY high level)

GCP = Google Cloud Platform

4 main services from google cloud
Compute
Storage
Big Data
Machine Learning

This course is predominately focused on 
Compute and Storage
As well as Networking 

What is cloud computing:
composed of 5 equally important traits.
1. On-demand self-service (No human intervention required).
	All services able to be obtained through an interface. 
2. Broad network access (access from anywhere).
3. Resource pooling (provider shares resources to customers).
	Big pool of resources, to unlock economical scaling for provider to make profit and save customer money. 
	Exact physical location not required knowledge for customer.  
4. Rapid Elasticity (Get more resources quickly as needed).
	Able to scale up/back at a moments notice. 
5. Measured service (Pay only for what is consumed). 

How did it get here
Phase 1 - Colocation - user configured and managed spaces in a single location run by several companies sharing the space/expenses. 
Phase 2 - Virtualization - similar to colocation but adding virtual devices separately managed from the base hardware. 
Phase 3 - Serverless - services automatically provision and configure the infrastructure for applications. 

GCP Computing architectures
More like managed infrastructure
	Compute Engine (IaaS Infrastructure as a Service) - Pay for what you alocate
	Kubernetes Engine (Hybrid)
	App Engine (PaaS Platform as a Service) - Pay for what you use
	Cloud Functions (Serverless Logic)
	Managed Services (Automated Elsatic Resources)
More like Dynamic Infrastructure

GCP Reigons and Zones

Multi-Region - things can be stored accross multiple different reigions (with at least 160 km between centers)
	This is also useful in establishing redundancies. 

Region - a group of Zones. All Zones within a Region have low latency between each other. 
	It is possible to build accross multiple regions as well. This accomplishes 2 things. 
		1. Make services more accessible for customers of an app/software hosted in GCP
		2. protect against potential loss of an entire region due to a service outage. 
	As of the time of this course there are 15 regions in GCP.
		29 regions as of 2022-01-04

Zone - a deployment area 
	example running a compute engine runs in a specified zone. a Zone does not always correspond to a single physical building. 
	A Zone can be thought of as a single failure domain within a Region. 
	When building within a region resources can be spread accross multiple zones to build fault tollerance. 
	
Trivia 
	GCP is 100% Carbon neutral since 2007. 
	First data centers to achieve ISO 14001 certification. 

cost trivia
	Billing is offered per second of use for compute, data processing and other services
	Discounts for use over 25% of a month are automatically applied. 
	Discounts for less steady long term work loads
	Discounts applied for interuptible work loads
	Custom VM Instance types only charged for the resources necesary for an application. 

Open APIs
	GCP database services are compatible with open source databases.
	GCP utilizes open sources licenses for additional portability to other platforms.



IAM Security and Resource Permissions

	
Multi layer Security approach

Operational security		^	Intrusion Detection systems, insider risk systems to protect against rogue Google employees. Employee U2F
							|	secure software development process. red team practices (active hacking excercises).
							|
Internet communication		|	Google Front End bakes in a DDoS protections. Checks for best practices (certificates etc.)
							|
Storage services			|	Encyrption while data is stored and not in use. Hardware encryption via SSDs.  
							|
User Identity				|	Central idenity service with support for U2F. Additional layers of security like looking for if someone has 
							|
							|	logged in from a given device before. 
							|
Service deployment			|	Encryption of itner-service communication.
							|
Hardware infrastructure		|	Hardware designed custom made servers and chipsets. Datacenters are custom designed and access heavily restricted. 
								crytpographic communication RPC traffic and data services automatically encrypted between datacenters. 


Tools to actively monitor costs of GCP services. 
	Budgets and alerts - can be defined per account or per GCP project. This can be fixed or tied to other metrics. Alerts can be created when 
						 budget is close to being exceeded. default budget alerts is 50%, 90% and 100%. 
	Billing exports - lets you store detailed billing info in easy to access locations. 
	Reports - visual tool to monitor expenditure. 
	Quotas - protect account owners and GCP. Many quotas are able to be changed on request. 
			Rate quota - resets after a fixed period of time. 
			Allocation quota - governs the number of resources per project. 



Projects - organizational unit for different initiatives in GCP. 
		   Group together related resources with similar business objectives.
		   
Identity and Access Management (IAM)  - to control access of who gets access to what. 
										least privileged access - each user should have only the necessary privileges to do their job. 
										4 ways to interact with this
											web console
											SDK and CLI tools
											via APIs
											mobile app

on premises care is responsible for all security
IaaS moves most of the lower layers (physical/hardware security as well as base software access) to be Google's responsibility
PaaS moves some more of the software responsibilities over to google. 
Managed services moves an even larger segment of responsibilities out of customer hands and puts the responsibility to google. 


The value proposition of this increased security is that through google's scale it can deliver a higher level of security then most could
provide on their own.
