Big Data and Machine Learning



GCP Big Data Platform
Google Cloud big data services are managed and scalable. (integrated, serverless platform)
	- Cloud Dataproc - managed Apache Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, Pig, and Hive service.	
		- Create clusters in 90s or less on average.
		- scale clusters up and down weven while jobs are running.
		- montitoring cluster can be set up in Stackdriver. 
		- billed on 1s intervals.
		- faster/cheaper to set up then the on-prem investments
		- able to use pre-emptible instances.
			- jobs must be able to be terminated and restarted in process. 
		- once data is processed you can use Spark Machine Learning Libraries (MLlib) to running
		classification algorithms. 
	- Cloud Dataflow - Stream and batch processing unified and simplified pipelines
		- good for realtime data or inpredictable data size or rate.
		- Processes data using compute engine instances.
			- clusters are sized for you.
			- automated scaling, no instance provisioning required. 
		- Managed data pipelines
			- write code once get batch streaming
				- Transform-based programming model
		- process overview
			- data read from a source (like BigQuery)
			- transforms data - data manipulation and processing.
			- sink - writes data to a source like Cloud Storage.
		- elastic pipelines.
		- General purpose ETL tool (Extract/transform/load) pipelines to filter, enrich, and shape
		data
		- Data Analysis: batch computation or continuous consumtion using streaming. 
	- BigQuery - analytics database stream data a 100,000 rows per second
		- BigQuery is a fully managed data warehouse
			- provides near real-time interaction analysis of massive datasets (hundreds of TB)
			using SQL syntax (SQL 2011)
			- no cluster maintenance required.
			- can load from Cloud Storage or Cloud Data Store or stream data into the DB
			- free monthly quota avaialable
			- Compute and storage are separated with terabit network in between
			- You only pay for storage and processing
			- Automatic discount for long term data storage	
				- Storage price goes down after 90 days of storage. 
	- Cloud Pub/Sub - scalable flexible enterprise messaging.
		- Supports many-to-many asynchronous messaging.
		- Application Components make push/pull subscriptions to topics.
		- includes support for offline customers. 
		- applications can publish messages and one or more subscribers can receive them. 
		- designed to deliver at least once delivery (some messages MIGHT be delivered more
		than once)
		- why use?
			- Building block for data ingestion in dataflow IOT and marketing analytics
			- Foundation piece for Dataflow streaming
	- Cloud Datalab - Interactive data exploration. 
		- Interactive tool for large scale data exploration, transformation, analysis and
		visualization
		- Integrated Open source
			-Built on Jupyter
		- only  paid for resources used
		- integrated with other GCP tools
			- analyze data in BigQuery, Compute Engine and Cloud storage using:
				- Python
				- SQL
				- Javascript
			- able to deploy models to BigQuery


Google Cloud Machine Learning Platform
	- leverages open source tool TensorFlow to build and run neural network models
		- wide platform support

			- Speech: Stream results in real time 80 languages are able to be detected
			- Vision: Identify objects landmarks, text and content
			- Translate: language translation including detection
			- Natural Lantguage: Structure meaning of text.
	- why Use?
		- for structured data
			- Classification and regression
			- recommendation
			- anomaly detection
		- for unstructured data
			- image and video
			- text analytics
	- Cloud Vision API
		- Analyze images iwth a simple REST API
			- Logo detection Label detection etc. 
	- Cloud Natural Language API
		- Can return text in real time
		- Highly accurate event in noisy environments
		- access from any device
		- uses ML learning models to reveal structure and meaning of text
		- Extract information about items mentioned in text docuyments news articles
		and blog posts
	- Cloud Translation API
		- Translate arbitrary strings between thousands of language pairs
		- Programatically detect a document's language
		- Support for dozens of languages.
	- Cloud Video intelligence API (Beta)
		- Annotate the contents of videos
		- Detect scene changes
		- Support for a variety of video formats
