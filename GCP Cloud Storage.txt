GCP Cloud Storage

Introduction to different data storage techniques. 
Cloud storage
Cloud SQL
Cloud Spanner
Cloud data store
Google Big table



Google Cloud Storage - Binary large object storage.
	- High performance
	- Internet Scalable
	- Simple admin overhead
		- Does not require capacity management. 

	- Not managed in a collection of folder and folder hierarchy. (File storage)
	- Not managed by OS storage in chunks of dis (Block storage)
	- IT IS giving google a bunch of bytes and Google letting you access it with a unique key (often in the form of a URL).
		- fully managed scalable service
		- do not need to provision space in advance.
	
	- use cases
		- website data
		- archival and disaster recovery
		- data objects for direct download for users. 
	
	- not a file system
		- each object has a url
		- each feels like a file
		- not used for a root file system in a linux box
		- comprised of buckets to hold storage objects
		- immutable objects
		- data encrypted on server side
		- data in transit encrypted via HTTPS
		- Online and offline import services are available.
		
	- when you create a bucket 
		- you give it a globally unique name.
		- specify a geographic location for the data to be stored.
			- pick a location to minimize latancy for users. 
		- pick a storage class.

Bucket attributes					Bucket comments
Globally unique name				Files (in a flat namespace)
Storage class
location (region or multi region)
IAM policies/Access Control lists)	Access Control Lists (fine grained permissions)
Object versioning setting
Object lifecycle mgt rules

Coud Storage data classes:


					high performance object storage		|			backups/archival storage

Intended for		most frequently		accessed w/in	|	accessed <				accessed less than
data that is...		accessed			a region often	|	1x per month			1x per year
														|
Avalability SLA		99.95%				99.90%			|	99.00%					99.00%

Access APIs								CONSISTANT APIS accross the board

access time						       Millisecond access accross the board

storage price		Highest				2nd highest		|	2nd lowst				lowest						Pricing for all classes per GB stored per month

Retreival price		Lowest				2nd lowest		|	2nd highest				highest						Pricing for all classes per GB stored per month

Methods of bringing data to cloud storage
Online Transfer				Self-managed copies using CLI (GSUTIL) or drag and drop 

Storage Transfer service	Scheduled managed batch transfers

Transfer appliance (beta)	Rackable appliances securely ship data (leased)


Cloud storage works with other google cloud tools and can interact with putting data in or taking data out.
 - BigQuery
 - Compute Engine
 - App Engine
 - Cloud SQL


Cloud Big Table 

Fully manged NoSQL, wide column database service for terabyte applications

sparsely populated rows, able to store petabytes of data
google manages this, low maintenance for users

good for operational/analytical DB

BigTable uses same API as Hbase offering native compatibility with bigdata Hadoop ecosystems.

Advantages of BigTable
	- Managed scalable storage
	- managed upgrades
	- transparent restarts
	- Data encryption in flight and at rest
	- IAM can control who has access
	- BigTable drives major applications such as search, maps, Google Analytics, and Gmail

Bigtable access patterns
	- Application AP - data can be read and written to Cloud Bitable througha  data service like Managed VMs, the HBase
	REST server, or a Java server using the HBase client. Typicallly this will be to server data to applications, dashbards,
	and other services
	- Streaming - Data can be streamed (AKA writen event by event) through popular stream processing frameworks 
		- Cloud Data flow Streaming
		- Spark Streaming
		- Storm 
	- Batch processing - Data can be read from and written to Cloud Bigtable through batch processes like
		- Hadoop MapReduce
		- Dataflow
		- Spark 
	Often, summarized or newly calculated data is written back to Cloud Bigtable or to a downstream database. 
	

Google Cloud SQL and Google Cloud Spanner

Cloud SQL is a managed RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
	- Offers MySQL and PostgreSQLBeta databases as a service.
		- Automation replication
		- Managed backups
		- Vertical scaling (read and write)
		- Horizontal scaling (read)
		- Google security

CloudSQL can be used with AppEngine using standard frivers.
	- You can configure a CloudSQL instance to follow an AppEngine Application.
Compute Engine Instances can be authorized to access CloudSQL instances using an external IP address
	- Cloud SQL Instances can be configured with a preferred zone.
Cloud SQL can be used with external applications and clients.
	- Standard tools can be used to administer databases. (SQL workbench, TOAD, etc) 
	- External Read replicas can be configured. 

Cloud Spanner is a Horizontally scalable RDBMS
	- Strong global consistancy
	- Managed instanaces with high availablity.
	- SQL Queries
		- ANSI 2011 with extensions
	- Automatic Replication
	
Cloud Datastore is horiziontally scaleable NoSQL DB
	- Designed for application backends. 
		- IE holding structured data from appengine apps. 
	- supports transactions
	- Includes a free daily quota
		- storage
		- writes
		- deletes
	- Auto scaling to handle load
